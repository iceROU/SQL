--Inserted Data from xlsx into SQL Server

--VIEW INTERMIDIARY DATA
select * from [dbo].['Meal Nutritional Info$']
select * from [dbo].['Meal Prices$']

--update [dbo].['Meal Nutritional Info$']
--set type = 'Vegetarian'
--where Type = 'Veggie'

--VIEW CLEANED DATA
select mi.[Meal Option], mi.Type, mi.[Calories (kcal)],mp.Price into meals from meal_info mi inner join meal_price mp on mi.[Meal Option] = mp.[Meal Option] 

--create new table with clean data
CREATE TABLE meals AS (select * from meal_info mi inner join meal_price mp on mi.[Meal Option] = mp.[Meal Option])

---CHECK FOR ISSUES
select distinct type  from meals where type like 'meat%'
select * from meals
select distinct [meal option] from meals

--update meals
--set type = 'Meat-based' where type = 'Meat based'

-------------------REQUIREMENTS-------------------------

select Type, CAST(AVG(Price) AS decimal(10,2)) [Average Price],  CAST(SUM(Price)*100 /(SELECT SUM(Price) from meals) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) as Percent_total from meals
group by Type
